# Usage of the EdgeImp.jl script

In this folder there is a sample [script](script.jl) that is used to set all parameters of the simulation along with locations to save the data to.
This script will call the module [EdgeImp.jl](EdgeImp.jl) in the modules folder.
The basics how the program works can be found in the Manuscript.
As a user you only need to edit [script.jl](script.jl) and run that with julia from the command line.
